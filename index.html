        <p>I am a recent graduate from CU Boulder with a B.S. in Creative Technology and Design,
            a multidisciplinary program within the College of Engineering and Applied Science, and a minor in Computer Science.</p>
            <p>I focus on bridging design and development to build meaningful,
            user-centered solutions through design thinking, technical problem-solving, 
            and collaborative iteration.</p>
        <!-- </div> -->
         <p>Iâ€™m currently seeking entry-level opportunities in UI/UX design and front-end development where I can continue learning, collaborating, and 
                solving  problems through human-centered design.</p>
