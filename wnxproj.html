       <h2>Project Overview</h2>
       <ul>
        <li><strong>Team:</strong> 14 members – divided into back-end and front-end teams</li>
        <li><strong>Role:</strong> UI/UX Designer & Front-end Developer  – led UX design and testing, UI creation, front-end implementation, and client communication</li>
        <li><strong>Tools:</strong> Figma, React Native, Gluestack UI</li>
        <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Partner with nonprofit organizations to support their software development needs. For Womenexus, 
            we created a community-focused app to help female-identifying students navigate academics, careers, and life transitions through peer support.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Background & Context</h2>
        <p>Blueprint Boulder is a software development club on campus that partners with nonprofits to build meaningful, mission-aligned digital solutions.
            As volunteer designers and developers, we collaborate with community-focused organizations to create software that drives real impact.
        </p>
        <h3>Client Specifications</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Match Matching Swiping Feature: </strong>An algorithm can group individuals together based on commonalities (e.g., classes, clubs) allowing users to swipe/friend other users for further connections. </li>
            <li><strong>Messaging: </strong>Users are able to message their connections.</li>
            <li><strong>Activity Feed: </strong>view connections, recent messages, and groups.</li>
            <li><strong>Profile Page: </strong>Users can customize their appearance on the app. Additionally the algorithm can use these items to group users together.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Problem Space</h2>
        <p>Female-identifying undergraduate students at CU Boulder need accessible ways to connect with their peers who can share their experiences so they can build a sense of belonging and find support around networking, academics, and personal challenges. </p>

        <h2>Research Methods & Practice</h2>
        <h3>Summarized Research</h3>
        <p>Our team conducted multiple rounds of user interviews with undergraduate female-identifying students at CU Boulder, using think-aloud testing on Figma prototypes. Interviews were split across team members and spanned the full design cycle — from an initial prototype that was handed off at the start of the project, through several iterations of the registration and networking flows. Participants were asked to interact with the prototype as if signing up and using the app for the first time, narrating their thoughts as they went.</p>
        <p>To keep feedback unbiased, I developed an interview guide with open-ended questions and prompted participants to think aloud as they navigated the prototype naturally. Interviewers were instructed to avoid leading questions and to observe body language and signs of confusion or frustration alongside verbal responses. Participants were asked to interact with the app as if signing up for the first time, and questions were tailored to each section. Registration focused on clarity and ease of setup, while the networking page focused on information layout and intuitiveness.</p>
        <h3>Key Interview Insights</h3>
        <h4 style="color: #757575">Users needed more context to feel confident completing their profiles.</h4>
        <p>Several participants were unsure what the app was for, what to put in the bio, and how skills and interests differed from one another. This pointed to a need for clearer onboarding language, placeholder hints, and a brief statement of purpose early in the registration flow.
        </p>
        <h4 style="color: #757575">The swipe-based networking mechanic, while familiar, carried emotional weight. </h4>
        <p>Participants recognized the pattern from apps like Tinder or Hinge, which made it easy to navigate, but one user raised a concern that the reject/accept framing could feel competitive or make users feel insecure if they weren't getting connections. This led us to reconsider the language and interaction design around that mechanic, shifting toward warmer, less binary options.
        </p>
        <h4 style="color: #757575">Navigation and information density needed to be rethought.</h4>
        <p>Users wanted messaging to feel more prominent, search to be integrated rather than on a separate page, and profile cards to reveal more depth on interaction. These findings informed how we structured the core screens in later iterations.
        </p>
        <h3>Design Iterations</h3>
        <p>The design went through several rounds of iteration based on user feedback. The process started with an initial prototype that was handed off at the beginning of the project. After the first round of testing and feedback, early versions of the registration pages were kept intentionally simple, focused on layout and flow without a fully defined color palette to isolate usability issues from visual ones. This allowed us to focus user feedback on the structure and interaction patterns without the noise of unfinished styling.

        <p>After testing and incorporating that structural feedback, we layered in the client's branding and color palette. This surfaced a recurring tension: users consistently reacted negatively to the color scheme the client had specified, which became one of the more interesting challenges to navigate, balancing user preferences against client direction. This kind of stakeholder constraint is a normal part of the design process, and working through it required ongoing communication about where user feedback could inform decisions and where client requirements took precedence.</p>

        <h2>Implementation & Handoff</h2>
        <p>Following the design iterations, we translated the registration flow into a working mobile application using React Native and Gluestack UI for the component library. The app was developed and tested using Expo Go, which allowed us to run the live application on our phones by scanning a QR code, giving us immediate feedback on how the interface actually felt to use on a mobile device rather than relying on desktop emulators.
        </p>
        <p>We successfully built out the full registration flow, integrating frontend logic with backend API endpoints to handle user account creation and profile setup. This included form validation, error handling, and state management across the multi-step registration process.
        </p>
        <p>The project was handed off to the client after the registration pages were completed, at which point the client relocated to pursue graduate studies elsewhere and transitioned the project to other developers for continued work on the networking and messaging features</p>
