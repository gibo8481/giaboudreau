        <h1>Capstone Project: bloc <em>Making For Everyone</em></h1>
       <h2>Project Overview</h2>
       <p>As part of the final year in the Creative Technology and Design program, I completed a two-semester Senior Capstone project focused on collaborative problem-solving and innovation.</p>
       <!-- <p>I worked with Andrew Widner, Matt Bloomfield, and Sophia Montie to identify a challenge and design a meaningful, human-centered solution by combining our strengths across design, engineering, and prototyping.</p> -->
       <ul>
        <li><strong>Timeline:</strong> September 2024 – May 2025</li>
        <li><strong>Team:</strong> Andrew Widner, Matt Bloomfield, Sophia Montie</li>
        <li><strong>Role:</strong> Design Technologist – UX design, testing, instructional design, front-end dev</li>
        <li><strong>Problem:</strong> CNC machining is inaccessible and intimidating for beginners</li>
        <li><strong>Solution:</strong> Gamified CNC interface, safety enclosure, beginner-friendly learning guide</li>
        </ul>
       <p></p>
        <h3>Background & Context</h3>
        <p>We began by exploring the current landscape of STEM education and makerspaces. Our research revealed several key insights:</p>
        <ul>
        <!-- <li>Identified a lack of equitable access to STEM and makerspace education, especially in under-resourced areas.</li>
        <li>Recognized barriers such as limited funding, equipment, and training.</li>
        <li>Aimed to make STEM and engineering feel less intimidating and more approachable to beginners.</li>
        <li><b>Believed that anyone—regardless of age or background—should feel empowered to start making.</b></li> -->

        </ul>
        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Fabrication can often be intimidating for beginners due to necessary prior knowledge and difficult-to-use machines.</li>
        <li>Most beginner machines on the market are either expensive or targeted towards younger audiences.</li>
        <li>Tabletop CNC machines lack critical safety measures and in-depth instruction required to operate them.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Target Audience</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Older children & middle schoolers (8-14)</li>
            <li>Parents & educators</li>
            <li>DIY makers & enthusiasts</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Common Needs</h3>
        <table>
            <tr> <td><b>Accessibility</b></td>
                <td>Often too expensive, complex, or unavailable for home or school use</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><b>STEM Gaps</b></td>
                <td>Existing tools lack practical, real-world applications and are too advanced for beginners, limiting their educational impact</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><b>Existing Curriculum</b></td>
                <td>Lecture heavy, with limited hands-on or creative expression</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><b>Learning Style</b></td>
                <td>STEM tools frequently overlook the needs of hands-on, exploratory learners who benefit from creative, open-ended activities</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><b>Home Engagement</b></td>
                <td>Parents need resources to reinforce school lessons effectively</td>
            </tr>

        <h2>Solution Oveview</h2>
         <p>We chose to focus on the CNC machine, a powerful, industry-standard tool, that remains less accessible than more common fabrication technologies like 3D printers or laser cutters. By centering our project around CNC machining, we aimed to bridge that gap and invite more people into the world of fabrication.</p>
         <p>We modified an existing tabletop CNC machine, designed a safety enclosure, built a gamified joystick interface, and created an innovation guide to teach learners the fundamentals of CNC machining.</p>
         <h3>bloc Objectives & Goals</h3>
         <h4>Make CNC Accessible</h4>
         <ul>
            <li><b>Safer</b>: limit switches, stop button, compact tabletop enclosure, joystick interaction.</li>
            <li><b>Affordability</b>: built with cheaper materials (e.g. recycled PETG, plexiglass).</li>
         </ul>
         <h4>STEM Concept Exposure</h4>
         <ul>
            <li><b>Geometry and measurement</b>: axes, angles, and measurements.</li>
            <li><b>Design thinking and problem-solving</b>: understand, ideate, prototype, test, and improve their designs.</li>
         </ul>
         <h4>Hands-on Skill Building</h4>
         <ul>
            <li><b>Fabrication techniques</b>: parallel learning between tactile and technological tools.</li>
            <li><b>Material handling</b>: selecting, preparing, and working with different types of raw materials for fabrication.</li>
           <li><b>Learning through</b>:
            imitation → modification → innovation</li>
         </ul>
